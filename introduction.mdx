## What is Taficloud

Taficloud offers an affordable, developer-friendly cloud storage solution that combines the versatility of Amazon S3 buckets with the simplicity of a regular file directory.
It also integrates AI-powered features, making it easy to manage and secure user-generated content like photos and videos.

Built on reliable and secure infrastructure, Taficloud offers a powerful, intuitive, and cost-effective object storage service.
With Taficloud's client SDKs, you can easily store images, audio, video, or other user-generated content.
On the server side, use the Taficloud SDKs to manage organizations, generate download links, and leverage Taficloud APIs to access your files.

## Implementation Steps

* Create and account on the [Taficloud dashboard](https://dashboard.taficloud.com)
* Get your [API Key](https://dashboard.taficloud.com/account/api-key)
* Use an [SDK]() of your choice (with the api key)
* Upload files on the client side and get the file Url within your system. ([See Examples]())
