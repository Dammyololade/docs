## Welcome

Welcome to the Taficloud API documentation. This documentation provides information on how to interact with the Taficloud API. The API is built on REST principles and uses standard HTTP methods. The API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.
